#Comapring the two coefficients we can see that both, Unumployment rate and People with bachelors degree or more have a positive relationship with 
#Violent Crimes, Unemployment being slightly more influential with a steeper coefficient. This means, the higher the uemployment rate, 
#the higher the rate of violent crimes, and higher the ratio of people with Bacherlors Degree or more, the higher the increase in violent crimes.
